## Target: Product Hunt / Landing Page Hero Video

---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[VISUAL: Dark screen, amber Verity logo fades in]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Misinformation spreads 6 times faster than truth online. Manual fact-checking takes 30 to 60 minutes per claim. What if you could verify anything in under 2 seconds?"

**[VISUAL: Logo transforms into product interface]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Meet Verity. Real-time AI fact-checking, powered by 15+ AI providers."

## PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:45)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - viral misinformation tweet, stock ticker dropping]**

**NARRATOR:**
"A single piece of misinformation can cost millions. It damages brands, misleads audiences, and erodes trust."

**[VISUAL: Person at desk, surrounded by browser tabs, looking overwhelmed]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Traditional fact-checking is slow. A single claim can take an hour to verify. And relying on one AI model? They hallucinate up to 40% of the time."

**[VISUAL: ChatGPT-style interface with "I cannot verify..." response]**

## SOLUTION (0:45 - 1:30)

**[VISUAL: Verity verification interface - claim being typed]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Verity is different. Instead of trusting one AI model, we query 15+ leading providers simultaneously."

**[VISUAL: Animation showing multiple AI provider logos flowing into consensus engine]**

**NARRATOR:**
"OpenAI. Anthropic. Google. Perplexity. And more. Each independently analyzes your claim."

**[VISUAL: Verification result appearing with 94% confidence, sources listed]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Our consensus engine synthesizes their responses using Bayesian statistics. You get a verdict, a confidence score, and source citations—all in under 2 seconds."

**[VISUAL: Timer showing 1.8 seconds]**

## HOW IT WORKS (1:30 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL: Code editor with API request]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Integration is simple. One API call. JSON response."

**[VISUAL: Highlight the response structure]**

```json
{
  "verdict": "TRUE",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "sources": ["NASA", "Nature Journal"],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

**NARRATOR:**
"Works with any stack. We have SDKs for Python, Node.js, and a REST API for everything else."

**[VISUAL: SDK logos appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Scale to Pro at $199 a month for 15,000 verifications. That's just over one cent per verification."

**[VISUAL: Calculator showing $0.013/verification]**
