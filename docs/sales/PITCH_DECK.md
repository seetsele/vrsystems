## Speaking Notes

### Key Talking Points:
1. **Pain point resonance:** "Every company publishing content faces misinformation risk"
2. **Technical moat:** "20+ AI providers is hard to replicate - took months of integration work"
3. **Business model clarity:** "$199/month for 15K verifications = $0.013 per verification"
4. **Urgency:** "Misinformation damage is accelerating - companies need this now"

### Objection Handling:
- **"Why not use ChatGPT directly?"** → Single models hallucinate; we eliminate that with consensus
- **"Is the market big enough?"** → $12.8B TAM; content moderation alone is $4B
- **"What about Google Fact Check?"** → Limited to existing fact-checks; no original verification
- **"How defensible?"** → Multi-model integration is the moat + first-mover advantage

### Demo Flow:
1. Show live verification at veritysystems.ai/verify
2. API request/response in documentation
3. Dashboard with usage analytics
4. Chrome extension live demo
