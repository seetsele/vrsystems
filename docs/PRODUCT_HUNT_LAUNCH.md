🔍 What is Verity?

Verity is a real-time fact-checking API that uses 20+ AI providers to verify claims with unprecedented accuracy. Instead of trusting one model that might hallucinate, Verity queries OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, and more providers simultaneously.

Our Bayesian consensus engine synthesizes their responses into a single verdict with:
• Confidence score (0-100%)
• Source citations
• Explainable AI reasoning
• Response time under 2 seconds

🎯 Who is it for?

• News & publishing teams verifying stories
• Content moderation at scale
• Enterprise compliance teams
• Researchers validating sources
• Developers building truth-aware applications

💰 Pricing

• FREE: 300 verifications/month (no credit card)
• Professional: $199/mo for 15,000 verifications
• Business: $799/mo for 75,000 verifications
• Enterprise: Custom pricing

🚀 Quick Start

1. Get your free API key (60 seconds)
2. pip install verity-sdk (Python) or npm install verity-sdk (Node.js)
3. Start verifying claims

Built by developers, for developers. Full API docs, SDKs, and a beautiful dashboard included.

## First Comment (Maker's Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], maker of Verity.

I built this because I was frustrated with two things:

1. **Manual fact-checking is too slow.** A single claim can take 30-60 minutes to verify properly. In a world of real-time content, that's not good enough.

2. **Single AI models lie.** ChatGPT, Claude, even Perplexity—they all hallucinate sometimes. Ask them about recent events, niche topics, or anything their training data didn't cover, and you'll get confident-sounding nonsense.

The solution seemed obvious: **what if we asked 20+ AI providers the same question and let them vote?**

That's Verity. Multi-model consensus eliminates the single-point-of-failure problem. When OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Perplexity all agree something is true, you can trust it.

We've also built:
- A Bayesian confidence scoring system (not just "true/false")
- Source citation extraction
- Explainable reasoning (see why the verdict was reached)
- Fast response times (designed for real-time use)

**Free tier:** 300 verifications/month, no credit card required.

Would love your feedback! Happy to answer any questions about the tech, pricing, or use cases.

🙏 If you find this useful, an upvote would mean the world to us!
