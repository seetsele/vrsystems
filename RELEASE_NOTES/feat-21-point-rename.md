Feature: 21-point system docs rename
====================================

Overview
--------
This change promotes the 21-Point Verification documentation to the canonical URL and preserves the previous `9-point-system.html` URL with an HTML redirect.

Impact
------
- Docs and marketing pages now show the correct branded messaging.
- Tests updated to reference the new filename.

Recommendation
--------------
Keep the redirect in place for at least one release cycle to avoid 404s from external links.
